This program utilizes the Marta API. Because Marta is a bus and rail system in Atlanta, GA, using an address from that area will show you the full effects of the API. Start it up and give it a test run! 

Here's an example address you can utilize:
117 Baker St.
Atlanta, GA 

Explore what happens when you input an address in the Atlanta region and when you input one that's not.
